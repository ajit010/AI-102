I have to create a learning path for coding with Python. This needs to start from the basics. The main aim of the learning path is to be able to develop Python code that can interact with Large Language Models. Generate a learning path, clearing breaking down the path into multiple modules.

Prompt

Seven years ago , Alan's age was three times John's age. Three years
since, Alan's age is two times John's age. What is Alan's and John's
age?
Step 1
Let’s Alan’s age be ‘x’ years
Let’s John’s age be ‘y’ years
Step 2
Seven years ago, with Alan’s age three times John’s age
(x-7) = 3(y-7) - (i)
Expanding equation (i)
x - 7 = 3y - 21
x = 3y - 14
Step 3
Three years since, Alan's age is two times John's age
x + 3 = 2(y + 3) - (ii)
Expanding equation (ii)
x + 3 = 2y + 6
x = 2y + 3
Step 4
Substituting the value of ‘x’ from (i) in (ii)
3y - 14 = 2y + 3
y = 17
Step 5
Using the value of y in equation (i)
x = 3*17 - 14
= 37
Final Answer

Alan’s age is 37 and John’s age is 17
Five years ago , Dave’s age was three times John's age. Two years
since, Dave's age three more than two times John's age. What is Dave's
and John's age?
